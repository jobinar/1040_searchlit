About: SearchLit allows you to get the price of books from various e-commerce vendors and compare their prices and choose the one that is appropriate for the user.

Installation procedure:

a. The app only works with devices having wifi with the device and the IP address of the server has been hard-coded in the app(very bad, I know). This may need to be changed and re-compiled if the app has to work. Will check if I can get this working some other way.

Usage:

Once the application starts, you can enter the name of the book or the author and you will get a list of books by that name. Click on the book name of your choice and then it will fetch the price of the books from various e-commerce sites and show a list of them. When you click on the price it will take you to the web-site of the particular clicked book with the appropriate URL.
